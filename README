This is a /proc based CPU utilization script. It is based off the phpcpubar script found on freshmeat, but I didn't like that you had to use an external C program to get the CPU stats, so I did it in PHP. It doesn't do an instant measure. It's an average over time. Read more about /proc/stat if you want to. Open cpubar.html in your browser. GD needed in your PHP install.
